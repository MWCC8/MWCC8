I am a Digital Strategy and Analytics Senior Consultant who holds a B.A. in Economics and History and a Master of Management in Analytics from McGill University. I'm broadly interested in using data, statistics, and machine learning to help people solve problems. I am particularlity interested in working on healthcare and environment/sustainability related problems.

My curiosity has always driven me to explore and learn new things, so I am always looking to work with new people to develop my skills and introduce myself to
new challenges.
