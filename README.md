I am a Master of Management Analytics student who is interested in using data, statistics, and machin learning to help people solve problems. 
I am particularlity interested in working on health care and environment/sustainability related problems.

My curiosity has always driven me to explore and learn new things, so I am always looking to work with new people to develop my skills and introduce myself to
new challenges.
